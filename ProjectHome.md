A fangame for the kickass webcomic Homestuck by Andrew Hussie.

Licensing is a bit strange so I should say this here to avoid legal issues: I do not own Homestuck, so many of the more specific portions of the game cannot be released under the GPL.

However, all of the code is fan-made and not owned by AH. The code is released to the GPL, if the game content is not.

...yeah the GC admins will probably kick this right away.

F_ing copyright, how does it work?_
